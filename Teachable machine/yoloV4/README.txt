Place YOLOv4 model files here

Expected files:
- yolov4.weights
- yolov4.cfg
- coco.names

You can download the weights from:
https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4.weights

Or use the helper in `yolov4_detector.py` to download config/weights. After downloading, restart the Python server so the detector picks up the model.
